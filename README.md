# React-Sudoku
A multi-featured Sudoku game made with React, Flask, and SQLite3.

I built this project beacuse I wanted to improve my skills with ReactJS and also wanted to learn how to create a full-stack web application.

A new Sudoku grid is generated each time the page is refreshed, and can also be generated by clicking the "New Puzzle" button on the toolbar. The "Solve" button on the toolbar instantly solves the puzzle using a custom back-tracking algorithm.
